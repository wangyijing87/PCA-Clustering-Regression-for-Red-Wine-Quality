# PCA-Clustering-Regression-for-Red-Wine-Quality

We will use the publicly available red wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform our analysis. The dataset contains 1599 instances with 12 attributes for red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.  

The following analytical approaches are taken in our analysis:
● Data Preparation: Prepare raw data for analysis
● Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Perform dimension reduction techniques to
identify a new set of orthogonal variables
● Cluster Analysis: Classification of wines based on physicochemical properties
● Regression Analysis: Prediction of quality ranking from the chemical properties of
the wines using Ordinal Multinomial Logistic Regression
